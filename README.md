# Applied-Linear-Controls
**Second iteration of Linear controls class that gave me applied understanding of analysis and design for sampled-data systems, identification of discrete-time dynamic LTI models from experimental data, and implementation of dynamic compensators on digital processors.**

#### Learning Objectives: 

- Transform continuous-time LTI models to discrete-time approximations
- Implement discrete-time compensators
- Design appropriate anti-alias and anti-imaging filters for a feedback control implementation
- Estimate dynamic system models from experimental data for use in design and analysis
- Design state-feedback and output-feedback controllers for discrete time implementation

#### Assignments Overview:
- [**Assignment1_Sethi.mlx**](Assignment1_Sethi.mlx) - Computation of Gain & Phase margins, pure delay frequency response, and selection of ADC chip.
- [**Assignment2_Sethi.mlx**](Assignment2_Sethi.mlx) - Building Anti-Alias Filter based on requirements and designing a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Sallen-key analog low-pass filter based on requirements.
